# Photos Scripts

Automation scripts for Photos.app.

## Scripts

- **Copy Photo Details** -- copy the details (location and date) of the selected photo to the clipboard.
- **Paste Photo Details** -- set the details (location and date) of the selected photo to those on the clipboard
- **Paste Photo Date** -- set the date of the selected photos to that of the details on the clipboard
- **Paste Photo Location** -- set the location of the selected photos to that of the details on the clipboard

## Installation

```bash
./install.sh
```

This will symlink the Photos directory to `~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Photos`.

If you already have a collection of scripts installed here, you can simply copy the ones you would like from the Photos directory.
